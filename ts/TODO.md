        - 0–15 mins | originality | freshness of the core idea, clever spin on the prompt | 7 pts 
        - 15–30 mins | theme | how seamlessly concept & early work reflect the challenge theme | 7 pts 
        - 30–45 mins | dynamics | visible collaboration signals: git flow, role division, sync-ups | 7 pts 
        - 45–60 mins | ambition | technical depth/imagination in structure & algorithms  | 7 pts 
        - 60–75 mins | code qual | readability, modularity, styling, in-code documentation |  7 pts 
        - 75–90 mins | core feature | robustness of the core feature | 7 pts 
        - 90–105 mins | polish | ui/ux finesse, animations, responsiveness | 7 pts 
        - 105–125 mins | risk | whether the team took on a technically ambitious or creatively bold feature in the last 30 mins, and how well it paid off | 7 pts
